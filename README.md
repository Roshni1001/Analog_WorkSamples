Analog Work Samples
Overview
Welcome to the Analog Work Samples repository! This repository contains a collection of my detailed studies and project documentation focused on various aspects of analog circuit design and analysis.

Contents
Voltage Transfer Characteristics: Comprehensive studies on the current/voltage transfer characteristics of various analog components including Zener Diodes, LEDs, and Transistors (BJT/MOSFET).

Circuit Design and Analysis: Detailed analysis of well-constructed analog circuits using tools like Pixelpulse2 and LT Spice.

Project Documentation: Each document contains in-depth explanations, methodologies, results, and conclusions from various analog electronics projects.

How To use:
Demonstration Video Links are provided for each part of the experiments. Ctrl+Click will lead you to the public gdrive.

Feedback and Contributions: Your feedback is valuable. If you have any suggestions or contributions, please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.
